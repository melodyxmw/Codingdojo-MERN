  Stable sort
  
  Time Complexity
    - Best:     O(n) linear when array is already sorted
    - Average:  O(n^2) quadratic
    - Worst:    O(n^2) quadratic when the array is reverse sorted
  Space: O(1) constant
  For review, create a function that uses BubbleSort to sort an unsorted array in-place.
  For every pair of adjacent indicies, swap them if the item on the left is larger than the item on the right until array is fully sorted

function bubbleSort(array){
    // The key part of this sort is that we run it until it's actually
   // sorted. In order to be able to tell that, we need some variable,
   // either numerical or boolean, to keep track. We'll use a boolean in 
   // this instance
   


   // As mentioned previously, we're going to run our little swap session
   // until things are actually sorted, so:
   do {
       // Now, we're going to go into each loop with the assumption that
       // the array is sorted, and change it back to false if we make a swap.
       let sorted = true;

       // Now, we want to start at the 0 index, and "bubble up" to the end

       // NOTE: this for loop stops one BEFORE the last element, since we'll
       // comparing each index to the NEXT index. This will prevent errors
       for(let i = 0; i < array.length - 1; i++){
           // Let's check to see if the number at index i is greater than the
           // number at the next index
           if(array[i] > array[i+1]){
               // If it is, we need to swap sorted back to false
               sorted = false;

               // and swap the elements
